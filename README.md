# JavaScript-Code-Quiz
This task required a JavaScript Quiz to be created that was multiple choice and would also allow players to record their score. JavaScript, Web API's, and HTML and CSS were reuqired to make this application.

The quiz was supposed to display questions one at a time, whilst there was a timer that was continually counting down. The qustions were to offer four multiple choice answers and then were to display whether the choice was correct or incorrect. If the answer given to a question was incorrect, the user was to recieve a time penalty.
